Hello! It's my life ambition to contribute to infrastructure, institutions & culture of a sustainable people, for life on Earth.
I'm in the process of baking several projects, which I'll vaguely list:
- Digital Gallery of The Future.
- A new USA constitution, an integral model for civilizations of the future on Earth.
- A vision of our future to inform the present.
- A self-generative artistic encyclopedia.
- Organic infographic design that's balanced to experience.
- Standards of digital education that's inclusive, interdisciplinary & engaging.
- A video series introducing critical skills for the human race.
- A code of conduct one can recite & adapt to commit to a life of compassion & integrity.
- New genres of music.
- New forms of education informed by worldbuilding, Ken Robinson's vision of education & models that empower instead of oppress.
- New community culture that combines the archaic rites we evolved in & modern tools that give us godlike capabilities.
- New models for worldbuilding in order to make paracosms into paracosmos.

And more...
Also looking for angel investors :D

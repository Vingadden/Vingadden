Hello! It's my life ambition to contribute to infrastructure, institutions & culture of a sustainable people, for life on Earth.
I'm in the process of baking several projects, which I'll vaguely list:
- Digital Gallery of The Future.
- A new USA constitution, an integral model for civilizations of the future on Earth.
- A vision of our future to inform the present.
- A self-generative artistic encyclopedia.
- Organic infographic design that's balanced to experience.
- Standards of digital education that's inclusive, interdisciplinary & engaging.
- A video series introducing critical skills for the human race.
- A code of conduct one can recite & adapt to commit to a life of compassion & integrity.
- New genres of music.
- New forms of education informed by worldbuilding, Ken Robinson's vision of education & models that empower instead of oppress.
- New community culture that combines the archaic rites we evolved in & modern tools that give us godlike capabilities.
- New models for worldbuilding in order to make paracosms into paracosmos.
- Social media forms that encourage wholesome connection instead of superficial influencer culture.

And more...
Also looking for angel investors :D


I'm looking for anyone who's like to discuss or collaborate on ideas like these... Future technology, software standards, security flaws, social media design in general, musicians, spiritualists or anything really... My discord is Vingadden#3773
